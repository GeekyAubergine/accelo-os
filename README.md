# Accelo-OS

As part of a hackathon we were challgned with making a "Silly Interface".

After some thinking the game [Mercy Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Meltdown) came to mind. The game saw you tilting the world to move a blob of mercury around a maze while changing it's colors to make the goal.

Building on this I came up with idea of the goals being the buttons for a OS control system. The player has to move the blob round with gravity to change it's color to then select the option they want.

The crowning achievement on this is the ability to control the gravity by tilting your phone. 

## Controls

- Use the arrows keys to tilt the maze and move the blob around
- Change the color of the blob by touching the (circular) color changes
- Once you're blob is the right color, move it over one of the buttons (square) to select it
- The colors match the options in the os on your left

Unfortunatently you can't use your phone. It was annoying enough to make it work for the hack, let alone make it reliable enough to release here. Turns out the gyroscope browser api isn't available yet.

## PS

This is from a hackathon, if it doesn't work for you, sorry.

Yes there are some hardcoded ip addresses here, it was a hackathon. The ip's are local, so it won't work for you anyway.
